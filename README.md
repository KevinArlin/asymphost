## Asymphost

Asymphost is a simple tool I threw together for my husband, Kevin, who wanted to be able to quickly share the output of some Asymptote code with others. Simply paste some Asymptote into the text-area, hit submit, and receive a URL in return (or Asymptote's error output, if you've gone awry somewhere).
